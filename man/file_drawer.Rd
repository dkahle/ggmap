\usage{
file_drawer(...)
}
\description{
To avoid downloading the same maps again and again, ggmap uses a
"file drawer" to store the maps you've downloaded. By default,
they will be stored in a session specific temporary directory
which will be deleted each time you quit R. If you want them to
persist across sessions, set the global option
"ggmap.file_drawer".
}
\examples{

file_drawer()
dir(file_drawer())

\donttest{# if server is unresponsive, R check will fail

# The first time you run this, the tiles are downloaded from the server
map <- get_stamenmap()
# The second time, the local cache is used so it's much faster
map <- get_stamenmap()

dir(file_drawer())
