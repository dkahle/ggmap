ggmap 2.6.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXES

* fixes a bug in qmplot that gives the error "Error in unlist(.all_aesthetics[1:42]) :
  object '.all_aesthetics' not found". (thanks to @Hughan.)
* gglocator now properly adapts to scaling. (thanks to @Nikolai-Hlubek)


ggmap 2.6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* geocode now has a force option to override cached values. (#69, thanks
@samfield)
* get_map now accepts as its location the result of geocode (you'll still
need to specify the zoom, it doesn't do that for you).

CHANGES

* get_googlemap now properly parses the scale argument.
* geocode now (again) defaults to source = "google" due to poor experiences
with dsk.

FIXES

* non-square map-images are now parsed properly. (#17, reported by @jonnybaik,
@krmlr, @dannguyen)

* geocode now returns typed NAs when geocoding fails.  this may help geocoding
in certain data structures. (#66, reported by @botanize)



ggmap 2.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* geocode can now get its information from datasciencetoolkit.org.  As this is
legally less restrictive than Google (and doesn't have a limit!), this is the
default method of geolocation in ggmap.  be careful with colloquial addresses
(e.g. "baylor university") though; google is much better at geocoding those than
dsk.

* maps now include meta data attributes containing their source, type, and zoom.

* ggmap objects now have a simple console print method describing them.

CHANGES

* geocode now uses datasciencetoolkit.org for its default source. be careful
with colloquial addresses (e.g. "baylor university"), google is much better at
geocoding those than dsk.

* geocoding datasets with the data argument of geocode is now deprecated, use
mutate_geocode instead.

* geocode now caches information on url hashes instead of the location queries
(thanks @geobrando).

* qmplot now defaults to maptype = "toner-lite" from stamen for better world
coverage (terrain is only available in north america).

* after begin deprecated, arguments lonR, latR, type, b, fullpage and expand
have now been removed from qmap.

FIXES

* geocode now works when output = "more" is specified.

* a bug in get_map that disallowed the use of stamen terrain-labels has been
fixed.



ggmap 2.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES

* ggmap now forms a directory in the temporary directory which caches queries.
To persist the cache over multiple sessions, set option `ggmap.file_drawer`. See
`file_drawer()` for more details.

* Functions related to the file draw and map caching are no longer exported: you
shouldn't have been using these anyway!

* ggmap is now slightly less verbose: Terms of Service references are moved to
package load. * geocode has been given an overhaul; it now accepts a data
argument for data frames (see examples), and no longer errors when it runs out
of checks. * stamen maps now hosts a wide new variety of maptypes that are kin
of the existing ones.  see ?get_stamenmap.  some stamen maps have moved to jpgs;
this has been fixed. * the license is now GPL-2. * cloudmade maps has been
deprecated; it's no longer clear how long the service will be offered.


NEW FUNCTIONS

* calc_zoom: calc_zoom computes a reasonable zoom level for either (1) lon/lat
variables in a data frame, (2) lon/lat ranges, or (3) a bounding box. *
get_navermap: use of the naver map service (thanks to Heewon Jeon).

NEW ARGUMENTS

* qmplot now accepts maptype. * several functions now have a force argument that
demands re-downloading of maps. * get_googlemap now accepts an api_key argument
for business users (thanks to Guy Carpenter for starting the process). * geocode
and revgeocode now accept client and signature arguments for business users. *
the style argument in get_googlemap is now much better (thanks @coxchristopher,
@djhurio, and @mattmoehr). * route now accepts transit for the mode argument
(thanks @corynissan).

FIXES

* fixed a bug in stamen cloudmade maps that resulted in a very (very) small
miscalculation in the bottom right bounding box of each tile. * several spaces
have been removed from google maps urls; in particular, language="zh-CN" now
works properly  (thanks to @JiangXD.) * unexported objects from ggplot2 and plyr
are now properly handled. * get_googlemap now properly creates a fileDrawer when
needed (thanks Eric Anderson). * authors attributions now use the person class.
* style argument fixed in get_googlemap (thanks @mattmoehr). * a bug in
get_stamenmap has been fixed that was making points at northern latitudes appear
even moreso for very low zoom (thanks to @amyszczepanski's discovery).

ggmap 2.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES

* now imports mapproj. * theme_nothing now accepts argument legend to prevent
legend wiping. * ggmap and qmplot can now properly display legends in the map
again, but transparency in the legend has been removed. (this will likely return
if/when ggplot2 allows an alpha argument to element_rect). * dataset crime now
has variable offense as a factor, month and day as ordered factors. * several
functions now message the user with the URL queried as well as the Google Maps
Terms of Service URL to better agree with Google's License Restrictions. *
gglocator now works properly.


DOCUMENTATION CHANGES

* documentation for get_map states that whole-world zooms are not supported.
(thanks to suggestion by john hendy.)



ggmap 2.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version brings ggmap up to date with ggplot2 0.9.2.

CHANGES

* geocode now returns the query as well with the option output = "more".  this
allows for easier merging with original datasets.  (thanks to suggestion by
garrett grolemund.) * geocode, mapdist, route and revgeocode now no longer close
all connections. consequently, ggmap now works with knitr. (thanks to fix by
yihui xie.)





ggmap 2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* get_map now allows for bounding box specifications with source = 'google'. *
new argument darken added to ggmap which allows the user to put a shaded layer
on top of maps.  this makes seeing color overlays easier. * darken, mapcolor
arguments added to qmplot.

CHANGES

* get_[google,osm,stamen,cloudmade] functions now check their arguments in the
function themselves as opposed to using an alternative function for argument
checking. * ggmap arguments changed a. fullpage and expand collapsed into one
argument called extent b. b changed to padding.  using b now issues a warning.
thanks to Jean-Olivier Irisson for the suggestions. * deprecated syntaxes now
properly call .Deprecated * ggmap documentation greatly enhanced. *
get_stamenmap and get_cloudmademap now message the user if more than 20 tiles
are needed.

FIXES

* get_map now attempts to determine an appropriate zoom when a bounding box is
provided. * qmplot now properly scales the expand on the x and y axes. (Thanks
to Jean-Olivier Irisson for the suggestion.)


ggmap 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* a vast array of new kinds of maps are available to the user.  these are based
on stamen maps (http://maps.stamen.com/watercolor/) and cloudmade maps
(http://maps.cloudmade.com/).  the latter allows for user-designed map rendering
(http://maps.cloudmade.com/editor#).

* the full google static maps api is available to the user.  in particular, this
allows for double the image resolution of google maps (which is also now the
default).

* qmplot - a version of qplot (from ggplot2) which automatically determines,
downloads, and plots the result on the appropriate map.  this function is still
experimental.

* make_bbox - a function which determines an appropriate bounding box for a
collection of longitude/latitude pairs.

CHANGES

* ggmap now imports all packages save ggplot2 instead of depending on them. *
ggmapplot no longer uses a textConnection for parsing base_layer. * geocode
fixes/changes : a. gcdf is no longer a global variable b. geocode now properly
uses the google geocoding api (like revgeocode) c. geocodeQueryCheck watches
your query limit with hidden global variable .GoogleGeocodeQueryCount * verbose
argument in function ggmap now deprecated, use messaging * center argument in
function ggmap now deprecated, use location * the ggmap function has been
totally overhauled.  it is no longer based on the RgoogleMaps functions GetMap
and GetMap.OSM but on functions get_googlemap, get_openstreetmap, get_stamenmap,
and get_cloudmademap. * ggimage has been rebased on ggmap:::geom_raster (a
version of ggplot2's geom_raster which smooths). * ggmap's version of
annotation_raster and annotation_custom are now exported as inset_raster and
inset.

FUNCTION NAME CHANGES

* the function called ggmap in previous versions is now called get_map. * the
function called ggmapplot in previous versions is now called ggmap.  the new
ggmap function checks its arguments and then either 1. proceeds with generating
a ggplot2 object or 2. errors suggesting the use of get_map.

FIXES

* bug was fixed which on some platforms caused an error in readPNG. * mapdist
now properly handles many from queries without exceeding google's distance
matrix api uri limits.  note that the api may still reject large queries - you
may want to run mapdist in a for loop.

NEW DEPENDS/IMPORTS/SUGGESTS

* ggmap no longer imports ReadImages. * ggmap now suggests stringr.

OTHER ADDITIONS

* a new data set on wind from hurricane ike (from NOAA).




Version 1.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features - 1. a total overhaul of the geocode function (with backwards
compatability).  geocode can now return more information such as the address
(for when the location is lazy-specified, e.g. "the white house"), a bounding
box, and political administrative bodies. 2. revgeocode - a reverse geocoder
using google maps. 3. mapdist - a function to compute distances on maps using
the google maps api.  distances in meters, km, and miles are returned as well as
travel times in seconds, minutes and hours based on mode of transportation
(driving, bicycling, or walking).  google query limit monitored with function
distQueryCheck. 4. route - a function to grab directions from google.  google
query limit monitored with function routeQueryCheck. several options are
available. 5. qmap now accepts base_layer argument.

Fixes - 1. qmap and ggmapplot now deal properly with maprange. *2. the
coordinate system is now properly set to a mercator projection. 3. custom
version of annotation_custom added (not exported) to allow for placement in and
plotting of overlays with mercator projection.

New depends - 1. rjson




Version 1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions - 1. ggmapplot now accepts arguments base_layer, maprange, and expand.
base_layer is a ggplot(aes(.), .)  call which allows the user to specify the
base layer of the plot which, when left unspecified, defaults to the four
corners of the map.  maprange allows the user to set the x and y axis limits to
the boundary of the map, and expand eliminates the white border space placed
around the map.  this also allows for faceting the map plots, see ggmapplot
examples. 2. qmap's arguments properly handled. 3. OSM_scale_lookup used for
better scale choices with OpenStreetMaps. 4. gglocator added following ggplot2
forum discussion by Tyler Rinker.






Version 1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes - ggimage and ggmapplot are now properly based on annotation_raster.
the custom geom_raster (and related dependence) has been removed.  dependence on
proto removed.

Additions - 1. theme_inset which allows for easy inset theming (exported) 2.
ggmap now takes latitude longitude ranges for OpenStreetMaps

Fixes - 1. qmap now properly sets the fullpage(=TRUE) argument when unspecified.
2. ggmap now properly provides a black and white image when specified.




Version 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
ggimage and ggmapplot are now based on geom_raster (new in ggplot2 as of version
0.9.0).




Version 0.8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes - 1. Further updated examples for a more efficient R CMD check. 2. ggmap
now calls geocode (see below) for geocoding. 3. packages now load quietly. 4.
grid now imported. 5. ggmap updated to ggplot2 version 0.9.0 which involved
changes : 1. legend = FALSE changed to guide = 'none' in ggimage, ggmapplot 2.
in ggimage examples, aesthetic "colour" changed to "colours" 3. in ggmapplot
examples, argument "to" in scale_size changed to "range" 6. .Internal calls in
ggimage and ggmap for color conversion changed to simple rgb calls.

Additions - 1. The geocoding subroutine of ggmap has been converted to its own
function called geocode, which is exported.

Version 0.7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes - Examples not run at R CMD check.

Version 0.6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes - ggimage and ggmap now properly reshape using the reshape2 package.

Version 0.5

Changes - ggimage changed to display coord_equal by default.

Version 0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGE GENESIS.
